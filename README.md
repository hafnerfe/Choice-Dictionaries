# An Optimal Choice Dictionary

Informally, a Choice Dictionary is a bit vector with two additional operations: Initialisation (i.e. the clearing of all bits) and Choice, which returns the position of a set bit.

This program lets you use an efficient implementation of a Choice Dictionary (invented by T. Hagerup) or create your own implementation and conveniently compare it with others.
